# PDFDocument_WordCloud
Generate a wordcloud of a PDF document to display the 100 most prevalent words

#How it works
1) Install Anaconda to run jupyter notebook
2) Install the required packages through terminal 
   - For Windows 10: 
        1) Open terminal through clicking on start -> type: cmd -> press enter
        2) Install required packages by typing into terminal the following: 
          py -m pip install --user numpy scipy matplotlib ipython jupyter pandas sympy nose pdfminer textblob
        3) Open Jupyter Notebook through Anaconda
        4) Create a folder through Jupyter Notebook where you would like to store all of your files 
          Note: I prefer making it on my desktop
        5) Save  a- the pdf of choice  b- the python file (opened through Jupyter notebook) in that same folder 
        6) Copy the code attached
        7) Save a mask image as a template for the wordcloud 
        8) Run the code
        9) Voila! 
        
 Note: You can make modifications to the code as you wish to improve the text extraction process for a more repsrentative word cloud.
